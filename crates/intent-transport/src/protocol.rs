//! The protocol version is independent of the daemon crate version and is

//! `system.status` → `protocolVersion`. Version 3.0 removes the
//! `pr.waitForChanges` router method (breaking; superseded by background
//! hooks, §5.40), covering 311 dispatchable method names (275 router +
//! 34 fast-path + 2 aliases) + 1 notification + 4 reverse RPCs. Version 3.1
//! adds the hook TTL (additive; §5.40): `ttlMs` / `expiresAt`, the terminal
//! `expired` state, and the `hook:expired` event — no method-catalog change.
